    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "- NLP is a way for computers to analyse, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. \n",
    "- By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.\n",
    "- Summarize blocks of text using Summarizer to extract the most important and central ideas while ignoring irrelevant information. \n",
    "- Create a chat bot using [Parsey McParseface](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html), a language parsing deep learning model made by Google that uses Point-of-Speech tagging.\n",
    "- Automatically generate keyword tags from content using AutoTag, which leverages LDA, a technique that discovers topics contained within a body of text.\n",
    "- Identify the type of entity extracted, such as it being a person, place, or organization using Named Entity Recognition.\n",
    "- Use Sentiment Analysis to identify the sentiment of a string of text, from very negative to neutral to very positive.\n",
    "- Reduce words to their root, or stem, or break up text into tokens using Tokenizer"
